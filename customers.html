                <p>
                  <b style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Verify the vehicle specifics:</b>
                  <br /> After confirming a ride is on the way, make sure the car matches what’s
                  listed on the ride-share app upon arrival. <br />Check that the make, model, color and license plate
                  number all match. <br />Beyond ensuring general safety, the measure is also helpful in busy
                  environments
                  where many similar vehicles are out completing rides.<br /><br />
                  <b style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"> Review a driver’s profile:</b><br />
                  In Blink, the Captains are rated on a scale of 'X to Y'. <br />A driver photo and average rider
                  “rating” will appear when a request is accepted.
                  <br />Don’t hesitate to cancel a ride if the driver’s rating, car or appearance seems
                  off. <br /><br />
                  <b style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Confirm you’re the passenger:</b><br /> A predator
                  could easily pose as a ride-share driver; never
                  disclose your name first.<br />
                  “Ask the driver who they’re here to pick up so you can confirm it’s the right person” who made the
                  request via the app. <br />
                  It’s a crucial way to ensure driver accountability and avoid any unwanted confusion for the
                  customer.<br /><br />
                  Travel with a friend: Strength in numbers is best, no matter the endeavor. In the case of
                  ride-sharing, <br />
                  “it’s always a good idea to travel with someone else,”<br /><br />
                  <b style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Always wear your seat belt:</b><br /> Even careful
                  motorists can be involved in accidents, <br />
                  so don’t treat ride-share precautions any differently — even on brief trips. <br />
                  The Blink app has a built in feature for safety of the rider. The way this works is <XXX………………….XXX>
                    <br />
                    All Blink Captains are quality assessed on safety and reliability and customer service. <br />
                    The process involves <XXXXX……………XXX>. There is a certification that is granted post qualification.
                      <br /><br />
                      <b style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Trust your gut:</b><br /> A driver who follows a
                      strange or unsafe route — or maneuvers
                      erratically or makes
                      inappropriate comments — needn’t be tolerated. <br />
                      Let young riders know it’s OK to speak up if they’re uncomfortable. <br />
                      “If it doesn’t feel right, change where you’re going or say, ‘I’ve changed my mind and you can let
                      me out here,<br />

                  High number of Blink rides accessible (how many customers choose to ride) and supply (how many

                  certain time and location. <br />
                  Low waiting time and accuracy at beginning and ending sites.<br />
                  Customers can track the Blink ride progress and can connect quickly with Captains as the Captain's
                  name and
                  phone number are visible after the cab has been reserved.<br />
                  Blink Captain and Customer recognition and tracking of the position.<br />
                  The Blink app SOS (emergency) button guarantees customer trust and encourages protection and
                  safety.<br />
                  There is versatility in making payment through any form, be it cash or non-cash (e-wallets, plastic

                    Rating of a Captain's output by customers and regular low rating will root out unprofessional
                    Captains. Similarly, <br />
                    the customers can score Captains, which may remove rude and offensive Customers since low ratings
                    and <br />
                    inappropriate behaviour towards the Captains may contribute to the deactivation of their accounts
                    from the application.<br />
                    A Captain would not need to think over overdue fares when transfers are cashless.<br />
                    No operating expense and no driving necessity for consumer loyalty.<br />
                    Social mobility, environmental security and cost reduction are the inspiration of cab pooling.<br />
                    For all Govt, it will be helpful. And as a govt, the customer. Parking room may not be accessible
                    <br />
                    so traffic is less and the individual will expend this sum on some short-term expenditure.<br />
                    Working families with only one vehicle will use this service with evolving lifestyle since
                    it is already discussed in their budget with other benefits.<br />

                <p>
                  No matter where you’re going, you have a right to get there safely. <br /> Your Captain should follow
                  speed limits and obey the law
                  during your whole trip, and they should be focused on the road. <br />
                  To be eligible to drive for Blink, your driver must be at least XX year old and have been
                  driving for at least XX years with a clean driving record, so you won’t end up with a reckless driver
                  who doesn’t
                  know how to drive. <br />
                  Plus, your Blink Captain will have gone through a background check for any criminal offenses to avoid
                  having a
                  dangerous driver on the road. <br />
                  Blink drivers must meet all requirements for auto insurance, so in the event of an accident, they will
                  have coverage. <br />
                  Any type of in-appropriate behavior from your driver is unacceptable. The Blink customer
                  safety policy forbids <XX...XX>. <br /> Drivers are discouraged from commenting on their passengers’
                    appearance or relationship status. <br />
                    If your Blink Captain says or does anything to make you feel uncomfortable, report them. <br />
                    A safe and clean vehicle is one of your rights as a customer. <br />
                    To be eligible for customer support, the vehicle must be <XX> years old or newer. <br />
                      Blink plans on leasing cars to drivers who don’t own a vehicle in our next phase. <br />
                      <br />Also, a car that doesn’t look like the vehicle as shown in the app may be an imposter.
                      <br /> Double check the license plate and vehicle information provided by the app. <br />
                      You have the right to report an accident or unsafe behavior that occurred during your ride.
                      <br />You can report your experiences directly to Blink, or, depending on the severity of the
                      incident, to the police. <br />
                      If you process your complaint through Blink, your case will be handled by Blink's customer service
                      team. <br />
